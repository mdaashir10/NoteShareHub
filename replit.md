# Student Notes Sharing Application

## Overview
A beginner-friendly Java web application using Servlets and JSP for student notes sharing. Students can download notes publicly from 4 predefined categories (Notes, Question Papers, Text Books, Guides), each with nested directory organization. Only the admin can upload or delete files. Uses Apache Tomcat as the web server with BASIC authentication for admin access.

## Design
- **Theme:** Dark gradient theme inspired by backbencher.club
- **Typography:** Poppins font family
- **Features:** Hero section, 4 category buttons, nested folder navigation, glassmorphism effects
- **Colors:** Purple/teal gradient background with colorful accent cards

- Navigate through nested directories
- Download any note file by clicking on it
- Clean breadcrumb navigation showing current location

### Admin Features (Login Required)
- Access admin dashboard at `/admin/dashboard`
- Create new subdirectories within any category
- Upload files to any folder
- Delete files and entire folders
- Navigate folder structure with breadcrumbs
- Protected by HTTP BASIC authentication

## Authentication
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin123
- Configured in `conf/tomcat-users.xml`
- Security constraints defined in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`

## How to Run
The application runs automatically using the configured workflow:
1. Maven builds the WAR file
2. WAR is deployed to Tomcat's webapps directory
3. Tomcat starts on port 5000
4. 4 category folders are created automatically if missing

## File Storage
Uploaded files are stored in the `notes/` directory at the project root (outside the WAR file). This ensures files persist across redeployments. The folder structure includes 4 predefined categories with full nested directory support.

## URLs
- **Public Page:** `http://hostname:5000/`
- **Browse Category:** `http://hostname:5000/list?path=Notes` or `Question Papers`, `Text Books`, `Guides`
- **Admin Dashboard:** `http://hostname:5000/admin/dashboard`

## Security Notes
- Admin endpoints (`/admin/*`) require authentication
- BASIC authentication is configured via web.xml
- File paths are sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Hidden files (starting with `.`) are excluded from listings
- Folder names are sanitized to prevent special characters
